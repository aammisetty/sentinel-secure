**Sentinel Secure** is a lightweight, client-side forensics and security dashboard tailored for Indian SMEs. It provides file anomaly detection, secure tools, and incident response workflows without sending sensitive data to the cloud.

Built with a distinct **Neo-Brutalist** design aesthetic using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Forensics Engine (Real Logic)
* **Shannon Entropy Analysis:** Detects high-randomness files (a signature of encryption/ransomware) locally in the browser.
* **SHA-256 Hashing:** Generates cryptographic hashes of files using the native Web Crypto API.
* **Magic Byte Detection:** Identifies "Extension Spoofing" (e.g., an `.exe` disguised as a `.pdf`) by reading raw ArrayBuffers.

### ⚡ System Monitoring
* **Live Heartbeat:** Monitors network latency and render loop performance.
* **Hardware Stats:** Displays available CPU cores and Device Memory via Navigator API.
* **Battery & Network:** Real-time listeners for connection status and battery health.

### 🛠️ Security Tools Suite
* **CSPRNG Password Generator:** Uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues` for cryptographically secure passwords.
* **Phishing Link Detector:** Heuristic analysis of URLs (IP usage, typosquatting, suspicious TLDs).
* **Browser Fingerprinting:** Displays data exposed to websites via the Navigator object.
* **Secure Local Vault:** AES-simulated local storage for sensitive notes.
* **Honeyfile Generator:** Creates dummy files to detect unauthorized modification.

### 🚨 Incident Response
* **Panic Button:** One-click WhatsApp API integration to alert the support team immediately.
* **Local Incident Log:** Persistent logging of security events in LocalStorage.

## ⚡ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+)
* npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/aammisetty/sentinel-secure.git](https://github.com/aammisetty/sentinel-secure.git)
cd sentinel-secure

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# Installs React, Vite, Tailwind, Lucide-React, React-Router-Dom

```

### 3. Initialize Tailwind (If not configured)

*Note: The repo comes with config, but if starting fresh:*

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev

```

> Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🧠 Under The Hood: The "Real Logic"

This project deliberately avoids mock data for its tools. Here is how the core features function:

### 1. Entropy Calculation (Ransomware Detection)

We calculate the **Shannon Entropy** of a file's byte stream.

* **Formula:** 
* **Logic:** Text files usually have entropy ~3.5-4.5. Encrypted files (Ransomware) appear as high-noise data, resulting in entropy > 7.5 (max is 8.0).

### 2. Magic Byte Analysis

We read the first 4 bytes (`ArrayBuffer`) of any uploaded file to verify its signature against its extension.

* *Example:* If a file is named `invoice.pdf` but the header is `4D 5A` (The DOS MZ executable header), the dashboard flags it as **CRITICAL**.

### 3. Authentication

* **Demo User:** Uses `reqres.in` public API to POST credentials and receive a real JWT token.
* **New User:** Uses LocalStorage with a simulated 2-step OTP process (Browser Alert -> Verify -> Session).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Sentinel Secure** is a forensic aid and educational tool. It is **NOT** a replacement for full-suite Antivirus software or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.

* It does not actively block processes.
* It analyzes files you manually select.
* The "Lockdown" feature sends a WhatsApp message; it does not mechanically sever network cables.
